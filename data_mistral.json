    "success": true,
    "response": " Success! You proposed a solution that addresses the issue of excessive energy consumption during peak hours. Here are some ideas you could present in the city council:\n\n1. Smart Grid Technology: Implement a smart grid system to manage and distribute energy more efficiently, reducing outages and energy waste. This technology can adjust power usage based on demand, ensuring that everyone has the electricity they need without overloading the system.\n\n2. Time-of-Use Pricing: Implement time-of-use pricing for electricity to encourage residents to shift their energy use to off-peak hours. During peak hours, when many people are using air conditioners, the cost of electricity increases, making it more expensive to run appliances at that time.\n\n3. Energy Efficient Buildings: Encourage the construction of energy-efficient buildings by providing incentives or requiring certain standards for new construction and renovations. This can include insulation, energy-efficient windows, and high-efficiency air conditioners.\n\n4. Educational Campaigns: Launch educational campaigns to inform residents about energy conservation practices they can adopt at home, such as setting their air conditioners to more energy-efficient settings, using fans instead of air conditioners when possible, and sealing any leaks in windows and doors.\n\n5. Community Solar Projects: Promote community solar projects to give residents an alternative to traditional electricity sources. These projects can help reduce the strain on the grid during peak hours and provide clean energy to the community.\n\n6. Urban Planning: Consider urban planning strategies that take into account the city's climate, such as creating shaded areas in public spaces, planting trees to cool the city, and designing buildings with materials that absorb less heat.\n\n7. Incentives for Renewable Energy Systems: Provide incentives for residents to install solar panels or other renewable energy systems on their homes. This can help reduce the demand for electricity during peak hours and lower overall energy consumption in the city.",
